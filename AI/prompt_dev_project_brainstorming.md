Decent "brainstorming" prompt, inspired by:
https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/05/how-im-using-coding-agents-in-september-2025/

<prompt>
I have an idea I want to talk about. I'd like you to help me turn it into a fully formed design and specification (and eventually a step by step implementation plan for us to follow when building it).
I'll start the conversation with a high level summary of the idea, and then you can review the current state of the project in our working directory to understand where we're starting from.
Then ask me questions, one at a time, to help refine the idea. 
Ideally, the questions are multiple choice, but open-ended questions are OK, too. Don't forget: only one question per message.
Once you believe you understand what the outcome should be, and how to go about delivering it, stop and describe the design to me.
Describe it in sections of 200-300 words at a time to help me digest it, asking after each section whether it looks right so far.
I will supply feedback, tweaks and additional thoughts that I then want you to incorporate into the design.

Very good point from the blog post, that I certainly recognise in myself:

"That last bit is particuarly critical. I find that AI models are expecially prone to handing me walls of text when they think they're "done". And I'm prone to just tuning out a bit and thinknig "it's probably fine" when confronted with a wall of text written by an agent. By telling Claude to limit its output to a couple hundred words at a time, I'm more likely to actually read and engage."
