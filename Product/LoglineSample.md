# What is this?

A "logline", a one page document, describes what you’re launching and the most important benefit the customer will receive. It's an abbreviated and easier to create take on Amazon's "pressrelease / FAQ" based "working backwards" methodology.

The logline can also form the basis of the customer communication through your changelog, and product updates. 

It's ideal for feature improvements. It also allows many people to create loglines on your team. 

Outline below.
