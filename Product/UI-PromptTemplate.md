# Goal
You're helping me design a wireframe for an app/feature that 
<your single sentence on your job to be done>.
Example: 
You're helping me design a wireframe for an web app that lets users log a bug and assign it to a teammate in under 30 seconds.

## Target user
<Who is this feature for, and what mindset are they in when using it?>
Example: 
A software engineer or product tester reporting a bug mid-flow. They're in a rush and need to get the issue logged and handed off with minimal friction.

## Success criteria
<How you will know your user has achieved their job to be done>
Example: 
The user can within 30 seconds and 3â€“4 clicks:
- Open the app
- Enter a bug title and description
- Assign it to a teammate
- Save it

## Key screens
- <screen 1>
- <screen 2>
Example:
- Bug list (default view, sorted by status)
- New bug form
- Single bug detail view

## Requirements
- <What your app *must* do>
- <What your app *must not* do>
Example:
- Must support: bug title, description, status (open/in progress/done), assignee
- Must support: fast reassignment and status updates
- Must not require account switching, complex onboarding, or configuration before logging
- Should be desktop-first

## Design intent
The UI should feel: <clean, fast, minimal, playful, etc.>  
Prioritize: <clarity, speed, minimal steps, mobile-first, etc.>
Example:]
The UI should feel: fast, minimal, focused  
Prioritize: speed, clarity, zero-fat UX

## Tech stack
<Your preferred tech stack, component libraries, etc.>
Example:
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- Shadcn
